# Raffle App with Meteor.js

Simple Web App made with Meteor.js to allow for small raffles.

Currently, the app is probably not following too many best practices.
This app is used to learn meteor, and as such there will be a lot of questionable code.


NB! The app is still using the insecure package because it is currently only in private use.
This should probably change at some time.
