# Raffle App with Meteor.js

Simple Web App made with Meteor.js to allow for small raffles.
I wrote this app to learn Meteor.js

The app has the following functionality:

* Save users (persons to add to Raffles later)
* Log in as Raffle Master (simple, without password)
* Create new Raffle
* Draw winner in Raffle
* Draw loser in Raffle
* Statistics
* Configure type of item the Raffle is about (wine, beer, other)
* Configure number of items in Raffle based on number of tickets (e.g. 10 tickets = 1 item, 20 tickets = 2 items, etc)
* Configure max number of items in Raffle (e.g. max 1 item, 10 tickets = 1 item, 20 tickets = 1 item, etc)
